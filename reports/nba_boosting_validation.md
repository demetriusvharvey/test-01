# NBA efficiency model comparison

Fixed-config sklearn logistic and histogram gradient boosting, trained before a distinct calibration season and evaluated in later seasons. No random game splits or test-driven promotion. Archive already inspected; not an untouched holdout. Player/injury inputs unavailable; no market baseline or wagering-source qualification. Research only.
